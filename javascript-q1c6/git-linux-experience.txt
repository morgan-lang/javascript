I learned Git Bash back when I got my HTML5/CSS cert in 2015, which is when I got my Linux System Administration cert. 
I first started using Linux back in 2000 with Redhat 7, and went on to prefer Debian and Debian-derived distros like Ubuntu 
until I learned CentOS 6.x and 7.x in 2015, which is what I run on my Digital Ocean droplet.

All that said, I don't think I'm particularly talented at using *nix, and I would never call myself an expert.
