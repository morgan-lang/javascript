<!--
--Create two constructor functions, one for dogs and one for cats.
--Create several dog and cat objects using the constructor functions.
--Make sure the dogs can bark and the cats can meow.
--Create a mouse (or some other kind of animal) by using an object literal.
--Add all the animals you've created to an array,  animals.
--Write a function, checkKindOfPet, that takes an array of animals. The function iterates through all the animals and checks to see if the animal is a dog, a cat, or something else.
--If the animal is a dog, display that information along with the name of the dog, and also make the dog bark.
--Likewise, if the animal is a cat, display that information along with the name of the cat, and also make the cat meow.
--Otherwise, display the name of the animal, and indicate you don't know what kind of animal it is.
--Test your code thoroughly!
