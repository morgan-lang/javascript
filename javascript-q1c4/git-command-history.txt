Title: Don't Make Me Think: A Common-Sense Approach To Web Usability, 2nd Edition
Author: Steve Krug
Why Recommend: I work in tech writing and UX design, and I consider this is a fundamental text. I look to it for guidance on simplifying text and design elements. 

Title: The Design of Everyday Things, Revised and Expanded Edition
Author: Donald Norman
Why Recommend: This is a fascinating survey/critique of industrial design and should be required reading for anyone who makes things for a living. The key idea is: the use of a thing should be apparent from its design.

Title: Cats' Paws and Catapults: Mechanical Worlds of Nature and People
Author: Steven Vogel and Kathryn K. Davis
Why Recommend: This book is key to understanding how nature and natural forms have been imitated and adapted by humans throughout history.
