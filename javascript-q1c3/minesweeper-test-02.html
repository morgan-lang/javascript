var userName = prompt("Hi! Ready to play Minesweeper? Great. What's your name?")
var userNumber = prompt("OK, " + userName + ". Go ahead and give me a number. Then, we'll create a minesweeper grid using that number. For example, if you give me the number 10, we'll make a 10X10 grid.");

//creating an empty array before we start pushing values to it:

var mineArray = [];

//Populating the array with the right number of zeroes by pushing the character "0" 
//for the number of iterations specified by the user in userNumber:

for (var i=0;i<(userNumber);i++){
	mineArray.push("0");
}

//Now, we can iterate through writing the correct number of rows, as specified by userNumber. 
//Note that writing the html <br> or "break" tag after each iteration is what creates the "rows",
//and using the "join" builtin function allows us to bypass the commas we would 
//normally see in an array by joining each value with no separator, giving us "00000..." instead of "0,0,0,0,0,0...:

for (var i=0;i<(userNumber);i++){
	document.write(mineArray.join(""));
	document.write("<br>");
}
