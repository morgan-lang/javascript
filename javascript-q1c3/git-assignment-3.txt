Angular looks quite promising to me. 
My front-end work has been limited to handcoding, Drupal, Wordpress, and Bootstrap. 
Angular looks like it's designed to let HTML5 do the driving, respecting HTML5's declarative orientation.
This makes more sense to me as someone more comfortable with HTML than JS at the moment. 
I doubt I could be of much use to the project, but I would like to use Angular.
