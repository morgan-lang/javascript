// homework:
// find the highest temperature of the week.


// Your code here
// I found this way of making Math.max work with non-number items in an array, such as commas. 
// This took me forever to solve, because simply applying Math.max would generate isNaNs when encountering commas. 
// The apply function forces Math to be applied to each array value.
var weekHigh = Math.max.apply(Math,tempsForWeek[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]);

// Create an array of days of the week e.g. ["Monday", "Wednesday"] // that hit that high temperature

//var daysOfWeek = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"];

// Your code here
// This one took a while, too. I couldn't see how making an array of day names was going to work with the existing code, 
// so I created new variables finding whether there's a match to the weekly high temperature using the find function.
// I know the correct way to do this is to iterate with loops to match values, but I couldn't understand how to do that 
//with the level of abstration we're operating at, where we have arrays of arrays.
var mondayArray = tempsForWeek[0].find(matchesWeeklyHigh);
var tuesdayArray = tempsForWeek[1].find(matchesWeeklyHigh);
var wednesdayArray = tempsForWeek[2].find(matchesWeeklyHigh);
var thursdayArray = tempsForWeek[3].find(matchesWeeklyHigh);
var fridayArray = tempsForWeek[4].find(matchesWeeklyHigh);
var saturdayArray = tempsForWeek[5].find(matchesWeeklyHigh);
var sundayArray = tempsForWeek[6].find(matchesWeeklyHigh);

//thought I might need this info for a for loop:
var numberOfDays = tempsForWeek.length;

document.write("The highest temperature for the week was " + weekHigh + ". <br><br>");
//The function matching daily highs to weekly highs:
function matchesWeeklyHigh(hightemp) {
  return hightemp == (weekHigh);
}

//Again, I should be using a for loop here, I know.
document.write("Undefined values mean the daily high temperature was less than the weekly high tempertaure. <br><br>")
document.write("Monday matched weekly high:" + mondayArray + "<br>")
document.write("Tuesday matched weekly high:" + tuesdayArray + "<br>")
document.write("Wednesday matched weekly high:" + wednesdayArray + "<br>")
document.write("Thursday matched weekly high:" + thursdayArray + "<br>")
document.write("Friday matched weekly high:" + fridayArray + "<br>")
document.write("Saturday matched weekly high:" + saturdayArray + "<br>")
document.write("Sunday matched weekly high:" + sundayArray + "<br>")
